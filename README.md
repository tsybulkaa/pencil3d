# pencil3d

Creating a 3D pencil purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a bit complex and may require more than just one file. However, I can provide you with a simplified version of a 3D pencil using HTML canvas and JavaScript, all in one HTML file. Please note that this representation will be quite basic.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., 3d_pencil.html) and open it in your web browser to see the 3D pencil:

In this code, we use the HTML canvas element to draw a simple representation of a 3D pencil. The drawPencil function is responsible for drawing the pencil on the canvas. The pencil body is drawn as a gray triangle, the tip as a black triangle, and the lead as a gray line.
Please keep in mind that this representation is very basic and not a realistic 3D model. Creating more complex 3D shapes in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript requires using libraries like Three.js or WebGL, which typically involve more code and organization.
